    "Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock offer a robust framework for implementing safeguards in generative AI applications, aligning with responsible AI policies and use cases. These guardrails facilitate controlled user-Foundation Model (FM) interactions by filtering out undesirable content and will soon include redacting personally identifiable information (PII), enhancing privacy. Multiple guardrails, each configured for specific use cases, can be created, allowing continuous monitoring for policy violations. The safeguard features within Guardrails encompass Denied Topics, enabling the definition of undesirable topics; Content Filters, with configurable thresholds for filtering harmful content in categories like hate, insults, sexual, and violence; and upcoming features like Word Filters and PII Redaction. The latter will allow blocking specific words and redacting PII in FM-generated responses, contributing to content safety. Guardrails are compatible with various large language models on Amazon Bedrock, including Titan, Anthropic Claude, Meta Llama 2, AI21 Jurassic, Cohere Command FMs, as well as fine-tuned FMs and Agents.AWS extends intellectual property indemnity, specifically uncapped for copyright claims, covering generative outputs from services like Amazon Titan models and CodeWhisperer Professional. This indemnity protects customers from third-party copyright claims linked to outputs generated in response to customer-provided inputs, emphasizing responsible usage and avoiding inputting infringing data or disabling filtering features. The standard IP indemnity safeguards customers from third-party claims regarding IP infringement, encompassing copyright claims for the services and their training data.\n",
